## üìà What‚Äôs next

I‚Äôm currently preparing **Guild** for MVP launch, fleshing out the kanban interface and building a single chat interface for interacting with multiple agents. Post MVP I'll be adding support for concurrent teams through one interface and isolating/sharing rag between parallel projects, like an AI company. Follow the repos ‚≠ê to stay in the loop, or reach out on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/lancekrogers) if you‚Äôd like to collaborate.
